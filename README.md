# Pinic-Quest-UI
Front End for text-based adventure game: Picnic Quest

The Picnic Quest front end design leverages React/JS framework and this [NES css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/) framework
to create a simple nostalgic feel that focusses on story content over graphics.

*note: this repository is a WIP for my Oregon State University Captstone project and will be finished by Dec 2022*
