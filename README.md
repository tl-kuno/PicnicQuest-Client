# Pinic-Quest-UI
Front End for text-based adventure game: Picnic Quest

The interface design leverages React/JS framework and this [NES css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/) framework to create a simple nostalgic feel that focusses on story content over graphics.

*Note: The back-end of this project relied upon an Oregon State server that is no longer active now that I have completed my education. So even though PicnicQuest can be accessed, it can not be played at this time.
